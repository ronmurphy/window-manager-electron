Here's a summary of our project and next steps:
Project Summary:
We're building a web-based window manager in Electron that currently features:

A tabbed web browser with draggable windows
Window snapping functionality
Widget system (with clock widget implemented)
URL handling and navigation
Dock/minimize system

Next Steps:

move the computer button in to the control stack (shutdown/reboot/dev tools) bottom most button
make a control panel with configurable options (color themes, change wallpapers, auto-start at load widgets, etc)
Implement tab dragging
Improve navigation controls (back/forward/refresh)
Add session persistence
Improve widget system

Widget visibility control (auto-hide)
Widget docking
More widget types


Add window layout system

Save/restore layouts
Quick-snap positions
Multiple monitor support



The core foundation is solid, with proper window management and flexible HTML/CSS structure. The browser component is working with proper webview implementation, though it needs tab management improvements.
Key Technologies:

Electron
Webview components
CSS Grid/Flex for layouts
IPC for Electron communication
Material Icons for UI

I realize that this could evolve into a lightweight desktop environment, especially for Linux systems. The modular nature means it can be extended with more widgets and functionality while maintaining a light footprint.
